      <h3>USS Titan (NCC-80102-A)</h3>
      <p>The USS Titan-A is a Constitution III-class starship. This implies that the refit Enterprise seen in The Motion Picture is of the Constitution II class. In the episode "Bounty", the USS New Jersey is seen, a ship of the original Constitution class. Early in Picard's first season, the Discovery and Strange New Worlds Enterprise appears in a hologram.</p>
      <p>Per "The Next Generation", warp 9.99 is the Titan's maximum warp speed. In the TOS scale, this is ~997 times the speed of light, while in the TNG scale, it is 7,912 times light speed. I am still working on revising the TNG scale, but it will follow this general rule:</p>

      <p>In "The Next Generation", it is clearly established that Riker captained the USS Titan (NCC-80102-A) at some point in the past. I think it is fairly clear that the vessel has just undergone a refit. However, there is no reason to assume it is the same ship as the NCC-80102. It is also possible that the original Titan, still under the command of Riker, was destroyed or decommissioned, the Titan-A was constructed and launched under Riker's command, and then, when the Rikers settled on Nepenthe, the Titan was given to Captain Shaw, or some other captain, as long as Shaw eventually became the Titan-A's commanding officer. It is most likely that Shaw took over directly from Riker, as Riker's music library was still present as of Shaw taking command.</p>
      <p>Lieutenant Matthew Arliss Mura, operations division, is apparently the tactical officer. He is a Bajoran and may be a member of the Cult of the Pah wraiths. Despite Bajoran sir names traditionally preceding given names, he is addressed as Lt. Mura, not Lt. Matthew. He has served on the Titan for three years.<sup>1</sup></p>
      <p>Ensign Kova Rin Esmar, operations division, is the communications (or perhaps operations) officer. They are a Haliian and can speak over seventy-two alien languages.<sup>1</sup></p>
      <h3>Date</h3>
      <p>In the penultimate episode of the season, "VÃµx", we learn that the NX-01 Enterprise "made its maiden voyage" 250 years ago the present. The Enterprise launched in April 2151. Therefore, this episode, and by extension, all or most of the season, must be set in 2401. Furthermore, the first episode of season 2, "The Star Gazer", must also be set in 2401, per the label on a case of wine bottles.</p>
      <p>The fact that seasons 2 and 3 are set within the first of months of a single year has several implications. In "The Star Gazer", it is harvest season in France. In real life, this can run as long as from late August to early October. So these must be some special variety of grapes, or there is some climate control that allows grapes to be grown at times of year when they morally could not be, or something similar.</p>
      <p>The short time between seasons 2 and 3 of PIC also means that Seven of Nine went on an extremely accelerated rise to the rank of commander in Starfleet.</p>
      <p>In "No Win Scenario", the stardate is given as 78183.10. In the next episode, "Imposters", the stardate is 78186.03. This gives us two new stardate counter-references that may be helpful in determining the system at work behind stardates.</p>
      <p>In "The Next Generation", we learn that Captain Shaw has commanded the Titan for five years, having completed thirty-six missions in that time. He must have taken command in either 2396 or 2395. This means that the original Titan must have completed its service history some time before that time, contrary to the vessel being pulled from service in 2398 after suffering extensive damage, as established by the Star Trek: Picard Logs.<sup>2</sup></p>
      <p>In "The Bounty", we learn that Worf has not met with Picard in eleven years, five months, four days. Therefore, the two must have last met in late 2389.</p>
      <h3>The Dominion</h3>
      <p>In "No Win Scenario", we learn that the Changelings have splintered. Some wish to continue the war against the Federation; some wish to reform and maintain peace. With the latest episode, we now know that the rouge Changelings were experimented on by a Federation scientist, explaining the shapeshifting-effect differences as well as other departures from the traditional portrail of Changelings.</p>
      <h3>Starfleet Intelligence</h3>
      <p>Commander Ro Laren is trying to uncover the Changeling conspiracy and is Worf's handler in Starfleet Intellegence. Worf in turn if Raffi's handler. Worf refers to Section 31 as a division of Starfleet Intelligence, although, from what we learned in Deep Space Nine, this is not true, and, we now retroactively know that it has not been true, officially, at least, since S31 went underground after the Control catastrophe.</p>
